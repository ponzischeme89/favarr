  <p><em>Multi‑server favourites concierge for Emby, Jellyfin, Plex and Audiobookshelf.</em></p>
</div>

Add or tidy favourites for any user without jumping between apps or asking them to log in.

## Highlights
- Connect multiple servers and store credentials locally (SQLite).
- Switch between users on a server and manage their favourites with one click.
- Unified search with fast suggestions across every connected server.
- Library, Recent and Favourites views share the same lightweight grid UI.
- Audiobookshelf support with user‑named “Favourites” collections (with tag fallback).

## Supported servers
| Server | Auth expected | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Emby | API key | Standard favourites endpoints |
| Jellyfin | API key | Standard favourites endpoints |
| Plex | X-Plex Token | Uses ratings API to flag favourites |
| Audiobookshelf | JWT token | Creates/updates a per-user favourites collection; falls back to tags if needed |

## Quick start (local dev)
Prereqs: Python 3.10+, Node 18+, npm.

1) Backend (Flask, port 5000)  
```
cd server
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/activate   # or source .venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

2) Frontend (Svelte + Vite, port 3000 with `/api` proxy to 5000)  
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000. The proxy sends API calls to the Flask server, so both processes need to be running.

## Quick start (Docker)
Docker image name is `ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/favarr:latest` (placeholder tag; update if renamed).

```
docker run -d \
  --name favarr \
  -p 5050:5000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \   # optional future bind for sqlite/logs
  ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/favarr:latest
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  favarr:
    image: ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/favarr:latest
    container_name: favarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5050:5000"
    environment:
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - ./data:/config   # future: sqlite db + logs
```

## Using Favarr
- Go to Settings → “Add Integration” and choose your server type. Supply URL + API key/token. Use “Test Connection” to verify.
- Pick a server from the sidebar, then select a user from the header dropdown.
- Browse Libraries or Recent to add/remove favourites, or use the Favourites view to prune quickly.
- Unified Search searches every integration and can warm its cache for faster suggestions.
- Logs tab shows the tail of `server/logs/app.log` for quick debugging.

## Production notes
- `frontend/npm run build` outputs static assets to `frontend/dist`. Serve them with any web server and reverse‑proxy `/api` to the Flask app on port 5000.
- Flask stores data in `server/favarr.db` (SQLite) alongside log files in `server/logs/`.
- Docker volumes above assume `/config` will be used for persistent db/logs once the container packaging is wired up.

## Roadmap (short list)
- Optional auth for the web UI.
- Docker image + compose example.
- Export/import server integrations.
