</div>

Favarr is a self-hosted favourites manager for Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, and Audiobookshelf that lets you edit any user's favorites from a single interface. It eliminates the need to log into multiple apps or remote-into family members' devices just to curate their libraries.

## Features
- God-mode Access: Switch between any user on your servers to prune or add favorites instantly.
- Cross-Platform: One interface for your entire media stack (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, and ABS).
- Fix Messy Libraries: Bulk-manage users who "heart" everything or help less tech-savvy users curate their collections.
- ABS Collections: Native support for Audiobookshelf user-named collections with tag fallback (e.g. Matt's Favourites)

## Intergrations
| Server | Auth expected | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Emby | API key | Standard favourites endpoints |
| Jellyfin | API key | Standard favourites endpoints |
| Plex | X-Plex Token | Uses ratings API to flag favourites |
| Audiobookshelf | JWT token | Creates/updates a per-user favourites collection; falls back to tags if needed |

## Quick start (local dev)
Prereqs: Python 3.10+, Node 18+, npm.

1) Backend (Flask, port 5000)  
```
cd server
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/activate   # or source .venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

2) Frontend (Svelte + Vite, port 3000 with `/api` proxy to 5000)  
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000. The proxy sends API calls to the Flask server, so both processes need to be running.

## Quick start (Docker / Compose)
Single image published to GHCR: `ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/favarr:latest`

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name favarr \
  -p 5050:5000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/favarr:latest
```

Or with Compose:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  favarr:
    image: ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/favarr:latest
    container_name: favarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    ports:
      - "5050:5000"
    # volumes:
    #   - ./data:/config   # optional: when persistence is wired up
```

Notes
- The image bundles the Flask API and the built frontend; only port 5000 needs to be exposed.
- `dist` is baked at build time, so rebuild the image after UI changes.

## Using Favarr
- Go to Settings → “Add Integration” and choose your server type. Supply URL + API key/token. Use “Test Connection” to verify.
- Pick a server from the sidebar, then select a user from the header dropdown.
- Browse Libraries or Recent to add/remove favourites, or use the Favourites view to prune quickly.
- Unified Search searches every integration and can warm its cache for faster suggestions.
- Logs tab shows the tail of `server/logs/app.log` for quick debugging.

## Limitations
- Audiobookshelf collections are global, not user-scoped, so “per-user favourites” are simulated by naming conventions and best-effort filtering; collisions are possible on shared servers.
- ABS collection APIs lack atomic add/remove; updates replace the whole item list, so concurrent edits can race. Favarr mitigates but can’t fully prevent this.
- ABS metadata is inconsistent across versions; fallback to tag-based favourites is used when collections break, which means favourites may appear as tags instead of lists.
- No offline mode—server APIs must be reachable to read or change favourites.

## Production notes
- `frontend/npm run build` outputs static assets to `frontend/dist`. Serve them with any web server and reverse‑proxy `/api` to the Flask app on port 5000.
- Flask stores data in `server/favarr.db` (SQLite) alongside log files in `server/logs/`.
- Docker volumes above assume `/config` will be used for persistent db/logs once the container packaging is wired up.

## Roadmap (short list)
- Optional auth for the web UI.
- Docker image + compose example.
- Export/import server integrations.
