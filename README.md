  <p>A favorites manager <em>(favourites if your American)</em> for <b>Jellyfin, Emby, PleX, Stremio and Audiobookshelf.</b></p>
</div>

FaveSwitch (formally Favarr) is a self-hosted favourites manager for Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Stremio and Audiobookshelf that lets you edit any user's favorites from a single interface. All you need is an admin API key for your media server. It eliminates the need to log into multiple apps or remote-into family members' devices just to curate their libraries.

## Features
- God-mode Access: Switch between any user on your servers to prune or add favorites instantly.
- Cross-Platform: One interface for your entire media stack (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Stremio and ABS).
- Fix Messy Libraries: Bulk-manage users who "heart" everything or help less tech-savvy users curate their collections.
- ABS Collections: Basic support for Audiobookshelf user-named collections with tag fallback (e.g. Matt's Favourites)
- Stats: Total user favourite counts, favourites by media type, and server breakdowns.

## Use Cases
- Manage favourites for family remotely by curating or fixing their lists without needing to log in as them.
- Clean up accidental favourite spam when a user stars hundreds of items or wrecks their own library.
- Control favourites across mixed setups like Plex for movies, Jellyfin for anime, and Emby for TV — all from one tab.
- Build curated watchlists for others (Kids, Parents, Friends) without needing their credentials or device access.
- Use a lightweight admin panel that requires no plugins, extra services, or server modifications — just your existing API keys.

## Intergrations
| Server | Auth expected | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Emby | API key | Standard favourites endpoints |
| Jellyfin | API key | Standard favourites endpoints |
| Plex | X-Plex Token | Uses ratings API to flag favourites |
| Audiobookshelf | JWT token | Creates/updates a per-user favourites collection; falls back to tags if needed |
| Stremio | Auth Key | Read-only library sync via cloud API (favorites add/remove not yet supported) |

## Quick Start
Single image published to GHCR: `ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/faveswitch:latest`

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name FaveSwitch \
  -p 5050:5000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/faveswitch:1.1.1
```

Or with Compose:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  FaveSwitch:
    image: ghcr.io/ponzischeme89/faveswitch:latest
    container_name: FaveSwitch
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    ports:
      - "5050:5000"
```

## Getting Started
- Go to Settings → “Add Integration” and choose your server type. Supply URL + API key/token. Use “Test Connection” to verify.
- Pick a server from the sidebar, then select a user from the header dropdown.
- Browse Libraries or Recent to add/remove favourites, or use the Favourites view to prune quickly.
- Unified Search searches every integration and can warm its cache for faster suggestions.
- Logs tab shows the tail of `server/logs/app.log` for quick debugging.

## Limitations of FaveSwitch
- Audiobookshelf <i>collections</i> are global, not user-scoped, so “per-user favourites” are simulated by naming conventions and best-effort filtering; collisions are possible on shared servers. E.g. two users can't have the same book (yet).
- ABS collection APIs lack atomic add/remove; updates replace the whole item list, so concurrent edits can race. FaveSwitch mitigates but can’t fully prevent this.
- ABS metadata is inconsistent across versions; fallback to tag-based favourites is used when collections break, which means favourites may appear as tags instead of lists.

## Roadmap
- User auth
- API - so you can see stats inside Homepage, other external services
- Export/import server integrations.
